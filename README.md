# Dotfiles

My collection of dotfiles for all the tools I use in my day-to-day as a developer and macOS user.

## Dependencies
- Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) before installing this tool.
```shell
$ brew update
```
- An ssh key which is attached to your GitHub account needs to be active on the
machine.
```shell
# This should list out a key which is active in your GitHub account
$ ssh-add -l
```

## Install
With homebrew installed, install tap:
```shell
$ brew tap mikemimik/brew
```

On fresh installation of macOS:
```shell
xcode-select --install
```

Clone and install dotfiles:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/mikemimik/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ ./setup.sh
```
